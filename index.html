        <h1>Privacy Policy for Texting Story Text Yourself</h1>
        
        <p>Texting Story Text Yourself ("the App") is developed by Jayesh Dhanesha ("we," "us," or "our"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use our App, in compliance with applicable laws and Apple's App Store requirements. We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

        <h2>1. Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>The App does not collect or store any personal data directly. All data generated by the App, such as chats and profile details, is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers or shared with us.</p>
        <p>We may access the following device features with your permission:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Photo Gallery</strong>: To export videos, send images as chats, or set profile pictures, the App may access your device's photo gallery. This access is initiated by you and requires your explicit permission. No images or videos are collected or stored by us.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In-app purchases are handled exclusively by Apple’s App Store, and we do not collect or process any payment information.</p>

        <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The App uses the following third-party services, which may collect data as described in their respective privacy policies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Firebase Analytics (Google)</strong>: We use Firebase Analytics to collect anonymized data about how users interact with the App (e.g., usage statistics, crash reports). This helps us improve the App’s performance and user experience. Firebase may collect device information (e.g., device type, iOS version) and usage data. For details, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
            <li><strong>AdMob (Google)</strong>: The App displays advertisements through AdMob, which may collect data for personalized ads, such as device identifiers (e.g., IDFA) or usage data. You may be prompted to consent to tracking under Apple’s App Tracking Transparency framework. For more information, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google’s Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not control these third-party services and encourage you to review their privacy policies for details on their data practices.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Storage and Sharing</h2>
        <p>All data generated by the App (e.g., chats, profile details) is stored locally on your device and is not shared with us or any third parties, except as described below:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Sharing</strong>: Data collected by Firebase Analytics and AdMob may be shared with their respective providers (Google) for analytics and advertising purposes, as outlined in their privacy policies.</li>
            <li><strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: We may disclose data if required by law or to protect our legal rights, but only to the extent necessary.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not store any user data on our servers.</p>

        <h2>4. User Rights</h2>
        <p>Since the App does not collect personal data directly, we do not offer options for data access, deletion, or opt-out within the App. However, you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Manage local data by deleting the App, which removes all locally stored chats and profile details.</li>
            <li>Opt out of personalized ads via your device’s settings (e.g., Limit Ad Tracking on iOS).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For questions about your data or third-party services, contact us at <a href="mailto:jayeshddhanesha@gmail.com">jayeshddhanesha@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
